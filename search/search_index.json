QNH and QFE Part of the \u201cQ-codes\u201d created by the British Government in roughly 1909, these are used to set altimeters to a specific reference. These, unlike most acronyms in the aviation world, do not have any direct meaning for their letter combinations, though some instructors think of the letters FE in QFE as being for \u201cfield elevation\u201d. QNH is the setting of the altimeter so that it will read the altitude above mean sea level (MSL) based on the location where that altimeter reading was set. This is to say that if you landed on an ocean, this setting would cause the altimeter to read zero. QNH is the most used reference in airline operations and several airlines prohibit flying using a QFE reference. QFE is the setting of the altimeter so that it will read the height above the airport that you are landing or departing from. The aim is for the altimeter to read approximately zero when the wheels of the aircraft touch down on the runway. Very commonly used during General Aviation flying or during early instruction. STD STD (standard) is the setting of the altimeter to reference to ISA conditions. ISA is an internationally developed and recognized model of how air pressure, temperature, and density vary with altitude, and for pilots, this means a QNH of 1013 hPa or 29.92 in.Hg. To fly a flight level (i.e., FL350 as opposed to 35000ft), all aircraft are required to be set to STD to remove any chances of differences between QNH causing aircraft to be closer to each other than the altimeters are indicating. The change from being on a QNH to STD happens at the transition altitude, and at the transition level vice-versa. A QNH/QFE is required to be set before landing. To set the STD in the Airbus, pull the dial that sets the altimeter, and push to return to QNH. in.Hg/hPA These two acronyms are the measure of the pressure around you, just as much as kg/lbs or cm/feet. In.Hg stands for inches of mercury, commonly used in the USA, Canada and Japan. The rest of the world commonly uses hPA, the hectopascal. The weather reports in the country you are flying to/from, will have the altimeter setting reported in the measure that that country uses. As you may fly from a country that uses one setting, to another country that uses the other setting, aircraft usually have a dial or switch that will allow the pilots to change from one measure to the other. In the Airbus, this is a turning switch behind the dial that sets the altimeter. Transition Altitudes and Transition Levels Transition altitudes and levels are the changeover points for the altimeter references to be changed. The transition altitude in the climb, and the transition level in the descent. Transition Altitude In the climb, the transition altitude is where you would switch from QNH to STD, and your altitudes will become flight levels. Every clearance ATC will give you above this will be called a Flight Level, and everything below will be called an altitude. This altitude is found on the departure or arrival charts of the airport you are departing from and will vary from airport to airport except for some countries. Usually, the demands of air traffic control or the terrain around the airfield will define what the altitude will be for that airport. In the USA and Canada, this is fixed at 18000ft to reduce complexity, whereas in other countries such as the UK or the Netherlands, this can be as low as 3000ft. Transition Level In the descent, this is where you would change from STD to QNH and is vice-versa to the transition altitude. However, depending on the pressure at the airfield on that day, this is not a fixed value and changes to accommodate high- or low-pressure waves. This means it can only be assigned to you by information from ATC, such as using an ATIS or by being told it through radio communications. In the Airbus, transition altitudes or levels can be selected in the performance page of the MCDU. As you cross over the altitude or level, the altimeter setting on the PFD in front of the pilot will flash to remind them to change over to the new setting. Some airlines only use transition altitudes in their MCDU, even in the descent. A common technique is to change the reference as soon as you are cleared to an altitude or FL, to prevent it being forgotten, as this can cause TCAS issues when aircraft are not separated by safe amounts.

There are a multitude of different approaches, divided into three terms, precision, non-precision and approach with vertical guidance. Depending on what equipment the airfield has, what the aircraft is capable of, what the pilot is certified to do and the weather that is on the airfield will determine which of these approaches you will do. Here are some of the more common ones you may see in an airliner. Precision Approaches (PA) A precision approach will give you full guidance, both vertically and laterally, to guide you down to a point where you can see the runway. This information can come from a set of radio beacons on the ground, satellite information or from a controller. Approach Type Equipment Used Used For Instrument Landing System (ILS) A localiser and glideslope radio beacon Most precise available, the most common for airliner operations. GBAS Landing System (GLS) GPS Satellite systems and ground transmitters A new alternative to ILS, for difficult approaches Precision Approach Radar (PAR) A radar dish and a controller Commonly as a backup, or at military airfields Lucash, CC BY-SA 3.0 , via Wikimedia Commons ILS ILS DiagramSimplified, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons Using a localiser beacon at the end of the runway, and a glideslope beacon at the side, the aircraft is guided along two radio signals to the touchdown point. These can be accurate enough to position the aircraft all the way down to touchdown and steer it along the runway. The pilots need to tune the ILS frequency into their aircraft's radio navigation system to receive the correct signals. GLS Like an ILS, but instead of using a set of radio beacons, the aircraft is guided by being fed information from a set of ground stations, which are in turn fed details about the position of the aircraft through GPS satellites. Not common, but as they do not need radio signals that go out in straight lines, the station can guide the aircraft around curves and turns to avoid terrain and built up/sensitive areas. Only some aircraft are equipped to do GLS and is only an option on the A320 family. PAR This is an approach where a controller, with an advanced radar, steers you towards the runway while telling you corrections to your heading or altitude. To the pilot, the controller will give you corrections such as, \u201cLeft 2 degrees\u201d, \u201cRight 3 degrees\u201d, \u201cSlightly high, correcting\u201d, to bring you towards the runway. When all other systems fail, this system can be used as a backup to provide these kinds of approaches, and several large international airports will practice these to keep the controllers skills current. Military airfields commonly use them as they can be setup much quicker than an ILS for use in temporary airfields and only rely on a radar, which can be portable. Non-Precision Approaches (NPA) A non-precision approach officially can only give you lateral guidance to the point where you can see the runway. This is fed either to the pilots either using a single radio beacon or by satellite navigation, but these cannot tell you if you are too high or low. The only way is to use a table off an aviation chart that shows you at what altitude you need to be at certain distances. Approach Type Equipment Used Used For Localiser Only (LOC) A localiser that would be part of an ILS system normally Some airports only have localiser but also when ILS glideslopes have failed. VOR-DME or VOR Only A VOR beacon with/without a distance from a DME Old style approaches, where ILS cannot be used. NDB-DME or DME Only A NDB beacon with/without a distance from a DME Old style approaches, where an ILS cannot be used LNAV Only GPS or the Aircrafts position inside the flight management computers Approaches where there are no radio beacons in the area Approach Surveillance Radar (ASR) A radar dish and a controller (No altitude compared to PAR) Commonly as a backup, or at military airfields. Visual Pilots eyeball! Where there is no issue with the weather and the runway is already in sight These approaches are all flown traditionally with just a beacon pointer, a localiser giving left/right corrections, or a controller giving rough headings. With a helpful co-pilot who will be using the altitude table to check if you are high or low, you keep correcting down towards the runway. As the term non-precision hints, these approaches are nowhere near as accurate as a precision approach and as such can require quite good weather to be able to attempt them. VOR and NDB beacons are slowly disappearing due to maintenance costs and the more useful APV approaches being made available. Approaches with Vertical Guidance (APV) A newer kind of approach, that uses both lateral and vertical guidance from sources such as GPS satellites, and does not require the use of radio beacons at all. At the time of writing, these approaches were not yet classed as precision, as they do not quite have the accuracy required but are constantly getting better with each new design. They are now flown very similarly to an ILS and do not require much input from the pilots. Approach Type Equipment Used Used For RNP/RNAV Satellite GPS systems and the aircraft's on board positioning system Approaches where there are no radio beacons in the area RNP-AR Satellite GPS systems and the aircraft's onboard positioning system As per RNP/RNAV but allow curved approaches with margins as little as 0.1 NM. The Different Categories of ILS With the ILS system, there are several categories that have different requirements from the pilots, the aircraft, the weather and the airport equipment. They are known as CAT, short for category, and are listed as both roman numerals and Latin numbers: ILS Category Autoland Required (in the Airbus) Weather (Normally) MDA or DH CAT 1 / CAT I No (May also be unsafe due to interference) Cloud base above 200ft Visibility 550m MDA CAT 1 LTS / CAT I LTS (Lower Than Standard) Yes Cloud base above 200ft Visibility 400m or 450m MDA CAT 2 / CAT II Yes Cloud base above 100ft Visibility 300m DH CAT 3A / CAT IIIA Yes Cloud base above 100ft Visibility 200m DH CAT 3B / CAT IIIB Yes (2 Autopilots) Cloud base above 50ft Visibility 75m DH (can be 0) CAT 3C / CAT IIIC Yes (2 Autopilots) Cloud base above 0ft Visibility 0m DH (can be 0) As the weather gets progressively worse, the higher the category you need to use, which in turn requires more advanced equipment both on the airfield and in the cockpit. To be able to do this, pilots are required to retrain on low visibility operations every year. The CAT 3C can be performed without ever seeing anything at all but this is not in practice yet as there has not been designed a system for the aircraft to be able to leave the runway and go to the parking stands completely blind. The A320 family are capable of everything including CAT 3C. MichaelDiederich CC BY-SA 3.0 Minimums and MDA/DH So, you have picked your approach and are flying towards the runway, but how close can you get before you decide it is a bad idea and to try again somewhere else? This is where the minimums come into effect. These are fixed values that decide how low you can go on the approach, and when you get to this altitude, you cannot go any lower until you can see the runway. Minimum Type Defined As Approaches Used In MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude) Altitude Above Mean Sea Level CAT 1 / CAT 1 LTS ILS VOR, NDB, RNAV, RNP, Visual, SRA DH (Decision Height) Height Above the Ground CAT 2 ILS CAT 3 A/B/C ILS These are defined in feet, (or meters if that airspace uses meter altitudes) and can be found at the bottom of the aeronautical chart that is published for that approach. Each approach to each airport will have a separate value, changing due to obstacles, terrain, and other things that may get in the way while descending towards the runway. Aircraft Approach categories Now depending on the aircraft you are flying, depends on the minimums you are allowed to use. These are grouped together by the approach speed of your aircraft, while in normal landing configuration at the maximum landing weight that it is certified to do. The higher the maximum weight approach speed means: The higher category is required, which means: The higher minimums are used. Aircraft Category Approach Speeds Typical Aircraft A < 91 knots C172 PA28 SR22 DC3 B 91 - 120 knots ATR72 C17 S340 TBM850 C 121 - 140 knots A320 A380 737 MD80 D 141 - 165 knots A340 A350 747 777 787 MD11 E 166 - 210 knots Concorde and specialist military MDA/DH on a chart ILS_RWY_23_KBUF.jpg: The original uploader was Centpacrr at English Wikipedia. Derivative work: Atmoz, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons In the above example, which is for the ILS or LOC/DME for Runway 23 at Buffalo Airport, NY in the USA, this chart uses a format designed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the USA. Each chart designer unfortunately has slight differences compared to each other, but the basics are usually the same. So, for the above approach: MDA (ft) Visibility (in 100s of ft (USA)) Visibility (m) Height above the ground (ft) ILS CAT 1 RW23 928 1800 550 200 LOC RW23 (Category ABC) 1060 2400 730 332 LOC RW23 (Category D) 1060 4000 1220 332 N.b. The brackets in the above image are used by the FAA for military operations, nothing to worry about in an airliner! In this example, for Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport, ILS or LOC/DME for runway 26L: SIA, CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0 , via Wikimedia Commons MDA (ft) Visibility (m) Height above the ground (ft) ILS CAT 1 R26L 520 550 200 LOC 23 710 1100 390 As this chart is now designed differently, it has described the MDA as a DA for the ILS. Now this is just a difference between charts and countries, some use one terminology over the other. Also to note is the inclusion of OCH values. These are the obstacle clearance heights of all possible objects on the approach path, so if you descend below this, then there is a possibility of a collision. These OCH values are not used by the pilots in an approach but are used by the professional bodies who design the approaches as to what the minimums values should be. Autoland Autolands are, unlike what the media might want everyone to think, not used all that frequently! The only time it is fully used is in conditions of bad weather, where the clouds are too low or the visibility not far enough to continue to do a normal manual approach. Special rules must be in place to prevent any interference with the aircraft, as this is a precise manoeuvre with not much room for error. Rules at airfield To fly an Autoland, the approach you are flying must be a CAT 2 ILS or higher. This means that only certain airfields can perform these, where the localiser and glideslopes have been certified as accurate enough to guide the aircraft to a successful landing. An airfield with anything such as an offset ILS, where the ILS is not aligned with the runway, will not be able to offer an Autoland approach. The airfield must also be in Low Visibility Procedures (LVPs).

This has the knock-on effect of slowing down operations at an airfield, as the normal rate of landings is now not allowed to reduce interference. From personal experience, an A380 vacating the runway at 90 degrees was enough to force an A320\u2019s autopilot to disconnect as the ILS signal was lost, which is something you do not want to happen when you cannot see anything! Rules on the Aircraft The aircraft must first be certified as capable of doing an Autoland and have all the equipment functioning that it was certified with. Many systems used must have a backup, especially for the very low visibility approaches such as CAT 3B/C, including dual autopilots. If any of these systems fail, the aircraft is normally reduced in its landing capability to a lower Category of ILS. The Airbus has an extra Red warning light in front of the pilot\u2019s eyesight which flashes if any Autoland equipment fails while the aircraft is performing an Autoland. Depending on when this happens, this can force the pilots to do a go-around to prevent an accident.

This is required to prevent any sort of interference with the onboard equipment on the aircraft as it is that sensitive to radio signals. Normal approaches do not require this level of protection, so many airlines now allow the use of devices during all phases of flight. As testing all possible devices that a passenger could possibly bring on board is a bit impractical, a complete ban is enforced to cover all potential issues. Nowadays, some aircraft have removed the No Smoking sign and replaced it with a No Electronic Devices sign to account for the change in times. A prerecorded public announcement is usually played and the flight attendants will check for devices being used before the approach is made.

An airport will have multiple SID/STARs for each runway, which will take you a different direction usually to a waypoint which connects to an airway. The airport will publish a chart for each SID and STAR, which should be checked by the pilots and followed unless cleared to do otherwise. SID (Standard Instrument Departure) These are the roads away from the airport, navigating around obstacles while keeping the aircraft safe from others with altitudes. Usually, an IFR clearance that you receive on the ground will have a SID or some form of departure instruction, which will depart you from the runway in use and connect onto the rest of your flight plan.

Although the diagram is a noise map, you can see that all routes have a common part to start with when they leave the runway, until they start turning away to their respective waypoints. This means that the noise of departing aircraft is confined to a particular area as best as possible, hopefully away from built up areas. STAR (Standard Terminal Arrival Route) Where a SID is the route out of an airport, the STAR is the way in. Extremely similar in design to the SID, this will route you down from the end of an airway normally, until ending at the start of the approach for the runway you are landing on. A STAR will have a route that also keeps it clear of obstacles/terrain etc. and give hard altitudes for the pilot to descend to when cleared. Some of these charts will also have holding patterns listed on them for controllers to keep aircraft out of the way to wait until the flow of traffic allows them to land. LNAV and VNAV With the advent of more complex autopilots and reference systems inside aircraft, aircraft systems are now much more capable of knowing their position in three dimensions. From earlier technology such as the CIVA INS, to the complex fully automated RNP approaches without any radio guidance that we have now, the terms LNAV and VNAV have become commonplace within the airliner world. LNAV (Lateral Navigation) The earliest form of navigation would involve a compass and looking out of the cockpit windows for landmarks, or possibly setting a heading and correcting for weather over distance.

These are defined using a latitude and longitude which are compared, in basic terms, against the aircraft\u2019s known latitude and longitude to allow navigation towards them. To know of the position of the aircraft, the Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) are aligned while the aircraft is stationary at the gate which sets a baseline position. This is then updated during flight using tracks and distances from radio beacons or has GPS data fed to it to keep accurate. Without these, as IRS systems are not perfect, the position becomes a guess, and the aircraft will slowly drift off route. This was a particular problem crossing the ocean on older aircraft, where there are no radio beacons and GPS was not invented yet, resulting in the aircraft being possibly miles off course when it eventually arrived overhead land. Vertical navigation VNAV allows for an aircraft to climb and descend using a calculated path to optimise the flight. It will maintain restrictions on SIDs and STARs, plan the ToD (Top of Descent) and minimise fuel burn while still allowing for the aircraft to get into a position to land. For VNAV to work correctly, the aircraft\u2019s computer systems must be correctly set with the correct weights, route, weather and performance information. With a good database inside the MCDU, the Airbus family can fly an entire SID or STAR with no interaction from the pilots, if the data has been checked beforehand. Speed and altitude restrictions are followed to match the chart information. The Airbus Flight Management will try to calculate a 3-degree path from the start of the runway you are landing on, working backwards through your flight plan to achieve all the restrictions until it arrives at your current cruising altitude. This will generate a point on the Navigation Display for the top of descent where if the altitude is set lower than the cruising level, and you push for DES, then the aircraft will follow the 3-degree path. The altitude always needs to be set lower than your current altitude, as the Airbus will stop at whatever is set in the FCU i.e., it will not carry on with the VNAV path. Unlike the Boeing fleet, the Airbus will also not automatically descend at ToD and requires a descent mode to be selected. Noise Abatement (NADP1 vs 2) To reduce the noise effects on local residents, some airports require the use of noise abatement procedures to help keep the noise levels down. On the airport, the reduction of the use of the APU and using more external power helps, plus the requirement to ban the use of anything more than idle reverse on landing unless the aircraft performance needs it. The big change that prevents a lot of noise is the use of NADP. These Noise Abatement Departure Procedures change the way aircraft climb out from the airport to help keep noise levels down at buildings that are directly under the flightpath. NADP1 requires you to climb to your thrust reduction altitude, but instead of accelerating at the same time, you hold the speed until you get to a higher acceleration altitude. This means that over the same distance, you will be higher than the normal procedure, also known as NADP2. And being higher over the buildings means you will generate less noise. Airports will describe in their airfield documents which departure you should be doing, but the standard method of NADP2 is probably in 80/90% of airports across the world. Common example airports with NADP1 are Paris LFPG, San Francisco KSFO on certain runways and Geneva LSGG.

These are defined using a latitude and longitude which are compared, in basic terms, against the aircraft\u2019s known latitude and longitude to allow navigation towards them. To know of the position of the aircraft, the Inertial Reference Systems (IRS) are aligned while the aircraft is stationary at the gate which sets a baseline position. This is then updated during flight using tracks and distances from radio beacons or has GPS data fed to it to keep accurate. Without these, as IRS systems are not perfect, the position becomes a guess, and the aircraft will slowly drift off route. This was a particular problem crossing the ocean on older aircraft, where there are no radio beacons and GPS was not invented yet, resulting in the aircraft being possibly miles off course when it eventually arrived overhead land.","title":"LNAV (Lateral Navigation)"},{"location":"airliner-flying-guide/navigation/#vertical-navigation","text":"VNAV allows for an aircraft to climb and descend using a calculated path to optimise the flight. It will maintain restrictions on SIDs and STARs, plan the ToD (Top of Descent) and minimise fuel burn while still allowing for the aircraft to get into a position to land. For VNAV to work correctly, the aircraft\u2019s computer systems must be correctly set with the correct weights, route, weather and performance information. With a good database inside the MCDU, the Airbus family can fly an entire SID or STAR with no interaction from the pilots, if the data has been checked beforehand. Speed and altitude restrictions are followed to match the chart information. The Airbus Flight Management will try to calculate a 3-degree path from the start of the runway you are landing on, working backwards through your flight plan to achieve all the restrictions until it arrives at your current cruising altitude. This will generate a point on the Navigation Display for the top of descent where if the altitude is set lower than the cruising level, and you push for DES, then the aircraft will follow the 3-degree path. The altitude always needs to be set lower than your current altitude, as the Airbus will stop at whatever is set in the FCU i.e., it will not carry on with the VNAV path. Unlike the Boeing fleet, the Airbus will also not automatically descend at ToD and requires a descent mode to be selected.","title":"Vertical navigation"},{"location":"airliner-flying-guide/navigation/#noise-abatement-nadp1-vs-2","text":"To reduce the noise effects on local residents, some airports require the use of noise abatement procedures to help keep the noise levels down. On the airport, the reduction of the use of the APU and using more external power helps, plus the requirement to ban the use of anything more than idle reverse on landing unless the aircraft performance needs it. The big change that prevents a lot of noise is the use of NADP. These Noise Abatement Departure Procedures change the way aircraft climb out from the airport to help keep noise levels down at buildings that are directly under the flightpath. NADP1 requires you to climb to your thrust reduction altitude, but instead of accelerating at the same time, you hold the speed until you get to a higher acceleration altitude. This means that over the same distance, you will be higher than the normal procedure, also known as NADP2. And being higher over the buildings means you will generate less noise. Airports will describe in their airfield documents which departure you should be doing, but the standard method of NADP2 is probably in 80/90% of airports across the world. Common example airports with NADP1 are Paris LFPG, San Francisco KSFO on certain runways and Geneva LSGG.

These have a standard layout as: AIRPORT ID - DATE/TIME - WIND - VISIBILITY - WEATHER - CLOUD - TEMP/DEWPOINT - QNH - REMARKS Metar Decoding AIRPORT ID It always starts with the airport ID as the 4 letter ICAO code EGLL = Heathrow UK KDEN = Denver, USA etc. DATE/TIME Then follows the Date and Time in the format of DDTTTTZ. So, the date in two digits, followed by the Zulu (GMT) time in four digits. The time is always referenced in Zulu no matter what time zone you are in. For example: 032050Z = The 3rd day of that month, 20:50Z or 8:50PM GMT time. If this is followed with AUTO, it means that the weather station is publishing the METARs without any intervention or checks by a human controller. WIND The wind field is written as direction in degrees true followed by the strength in knots. So 36011KT is a wind of 11 knots coming from 360 degrees (north). Some countries still use meters per second (MPS) which will replace the KT so you know which measure is in use. A G can also be added for gusts, e.g. 36011G28KT. The letters VRB can replace the direction to say it is blowing in a variable direction. After the wind, there can be two directions with a V in between if a strong variable wind is blowing. 240V350 means the wind is varying between 240 degrees and 350 degrees. VISIBILITY The visibility field comes next, with prevailing distance in meters in four digits and goes up to 9999 if it is greater than 10km visibility. Some countries use statute miles which will be labelled SM. If there is a minimum visibility in a certain direction, this will come next as the same format as the prevailing distance but with a direction afterwards in letters, for example 1500NW will mean that in the northwest direction it is down to 1500m. RVR is the final option, which shows the distance you can see down a runway in meters. It will be in the format of the runway designator/meters, and can have a D, N or U to show its decreasing, staying the same or going up, such as R28L/1000D.

This is where the ATIS comes in, which is a message transmitted over a specific radio frequency that gives a spoken reading of the current weather and useful information on the airfield such as the runways in use or if any taxiways are closed. These are always started and ended with a letter, \u201cInformation Charlie\u201d, which is told to the departure or approach controllers when you first speak to them to confirm that you have listened to the latest ATIS information. This message changes after so many minutes depending on the airport's updating frequency, and when it does, the next letter in the alphabet is then used at the start and end of the new message. Now to make things easier, Digital ATIS is starting to be used throughout the world, which allows for the aircraft to print out a text version of the ATIS from a distance beyond the range of the radio frequency. This means that the workload in the cockpit is much less, as some ATIS radios can only be received in the descent. Here is an example of a DATIS: Credit - Shomas [Z] Pilot on Discord \"I guess you can see why I saved this one\" As you can see, this is information W, Whiskey for Manchester, UK EGCC. The weather information is written out in a METAR like format, but with the addition of a QFE as well. The extra airfield information starting from the top on this particular ATIS is: The arrival runway (23R) The runway state (Wet at the start, middle and end) The transition level (FL70) That single runway operations are in effect That moderate turbulence has been reported (due to the 53kt wind!)

This is where the ATIS comes in, which is a message transmitted over a specific radio frequency that gives a spoken reading of the current weather and useful information on the airfield such as the runways in use or if any taxiways are closed. These are always started and ended with a letter, \u201cInformation Charlie\u201d, which is told to the departure or approach controllers when you first speak to them to confirm that you have listened to the latest ATIS information. This message changes after so many minutes depending on the airport's updating frequency, and when it does, the next letter in the alphabet is then used at the start and end of the new message. Now to make things easier, Digital ATIS is starting to be used throughout the world, which allows for the aircraft to print out a text version of the ATIS from a distance beyond the range of the radio frequency. This means that the workload in the cockpit is much less, as some ATIS radios can only be received in the descent. Here is an example of a DATIS: Credit - Shomas [Z] Pilot on Discord \"I guess you can see why I saved this one\" As you can see, this is information W, Whiskey for Manchester, UK EGCC. The weather information is written out in a METAR like format, but with the addition of a QFE as well. The extra airfield information starting from the top on this particular ATIS is: The arrival runway (23R) The runway state (Wet at the start, middle and end) The transition level (FL70) That single runway operations are in effect That moderate turbulence has been reported (due to the 53kt wind!)

Any lower performance may result in unexpected behaviour. Use modern flight model (legacy flight model is not supported) It's crucial for the Autothrust system to have properly setup detents. Ensure that you have enough dead zone around the detents. Typical issues when this is not done properly: constantly flashing \"LVR CLB\", FLX / TOGA not engaging or ATHR not holding speed correctly (the latter can also happen when in CLB/OP CLB or DES/OP DES and flying manually -> in that case you need to take care of holding speed with pitch) any mod or add-on that changes the physics or has impact on the flight model are not supported Reporting issues When reporting issues please take the following into account: read the known and typical issues to be sure it's not already known or can be solved that way have a look at your fps note down which flight condition you are (in flight, on ground) note down what the FMA showed (or even better: take a screenshot or make a video) you can press the DFDR button (right of the throttle levers and above the TCAS panel) to mark an event if you ask for support you might be asked for a FDR file, those can be found in the work folder (see below) Work folder location Microsoft Store Version The work folder can be found here: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState\\packages\\flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo\\work\\ Steam Version The work folder can be found here: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft Flight Simulator\\Packages\\flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo\\work\\ Custom Autopilot and Autothrust System incl. new Engine model \u26a0\ufe0f This is work in progress, there are still issues, see the Known Issues Typical issues and how to solve them FMA keeps blinking with message LVR CLB If this is the case your throttle calibration is not properly. The values of the throttle axis range from -1.0 to 1.0 independently if you're using reverse on axis or not. When the current throttle position is larger or equal then the start position and smaller or equal than the end position of a detent, the throttles are considered to be in that detent. Ensure that: detents are large enough defined so hardware inaccuracy is taken into account (i.e. detents on the Thrustmaster TCA are not that hard and values can quite differ even one thinks it's in the detent there is enough range between the detents (meaning end position of detent and start position of next detent are at least wide as the detents) Important : if you have issues, don't look at the animation part to check if it's in the detent. Check the values in the EFB, those are relevant and not the animation. Autothrust does not hold target speed in manual flight Important rule is to always monitor the FMA. If you're in manual flight and you're in CLB , OP CLB , DES or OP DES the autothrust applies either THR CLB (limited by the throttle levers) or THR IDLE . The speed needs to be controlled by pitch and in manual flight the pilot is responsible to do so by following the flight director orders. If this is not your desired mode, you can do two things: engage another vertical mode (i.e. V/S or FPA) disengage both flight directors, this will force the Autothrust into SPEED mode Reminder : Speed is only controlled properly using thrust when Autothrust is engaged and active, thrust levers are in detent CLB, active FMA mode is SPEED or MACH . SRS does not engage on take-off SRS mode needs at least a V2 entered on TO PERF page. Additionally it does only engage when the detents are set properly. If no FLX temperature is set, this needs to be TOGA. If a FLX temperature is set, it's FLX/MCT or TOGA. Other conditions: plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground Flaps extended at least in position 1+F RWY does not engage on take-off There is currently no auto-tune available for the LOC on take-off. You need to enter the right frequency manually. Beside that RWY mode only engages with the following conditions: LOC signal valid LOC deviation smaller than 1/2 dot Deviation between plane heading and LOC bearing is < 20\u00b0 Plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground Flaps extended at least in position 1+F LVR CLB flashes immediately after lift-off Ensure that both thrust reduction and acceleration altitude on TO PERF page are properly setup. LAND mode does not engage Before reaching 400 ft radio altitude the FMA needs to show LOC and G/S . If one of them is still in capture mode ( LOC* or G/S* ) you need to perform a go around maneuver or land manually, LAND will not engage that way. Autoland does not perform as expected The Autoland system is quite complex and is dependent on multiple environmental conditions to work properly, such as: LOC accuracy in terms of alignment of heading to runway heading alignment on runway centerline availability down to 0 ft and also during roll-out G/S accuracy in terms of alignment to correct height (50 ft over runway threshold) availability down to 50 ft ground in front of runway threshold needs to be more or less stable (no fast raising terrain) beginning 200 ft radio altitude Reminder: If the autoland warning light goes on it's IRL procedure to go around! Unfortunately a lot of runways (either using Navigraph or not) have issues for LOC and/or G/S, either in terms of alignment or availability. On many runways you loose the LOC during ROLL OUT . In that case the roll out has to be performed manually by disengaging the AP. Flight controls are not working after reload of the sim or airplane Ensure that no SimConnect.cfg is in the Documents folder of your user profile. An older version of Kinetic Assistant installed that file and it's causing issues with SimConnect connection between our custom systems and the sim. Autopilot is osciallating on approach or in flight Ensure that you get enough frames per second (see on top). Climb performance is not satisfying or plane drops or increases nose heavily on approach Ensure that you're using modern flight model (Options -> General -> Flight Model). Beside that also ensure that you don't have any mods or add-ons installed that have influence on the flight model or other physics. Autopilot oscillates when using time compression Time compression is not fully supported yet, this applies also to fuel burn (time compression is not taken into account). The reason why it can work for some and not for others is how time compression is working. For example when using time compression of 2x for the custom systems it's like having 1/2 of your displayed fps, when you're using 4x it's like 1/4 of it. So taking into account the 17 fps requirement it means you need ~ 30 fps and ~ 45 fps for 4x to work somehow, at least for smooth cruise. When you encounter heavy turbulence it might be needed that time compression is reduced. For the time being we do not recommend using it. Ailerons are not working when using the keyboard There is currently an issue with the associated events and there is currently no way to solve it. We highly recommend using a controller with an axis assigned to use the plane. Known issues Not solved or missing (this list is not conclusive) Flight Management \u274c Due to lack of LNAV, the flaws of the default flight plan manager still apply (bank to left or right shortly after TO etc) \u274c Due to lack of VNAV, DES mode is currently only using SPD/MACH \u274c Due to lack of VNAV, RNAV approaches are not supported yet Autopilot \u274c AP disconnect does not trigger master warning etc. \u274c NAV mode being armed might show dashes in the FCU instead of selected HDG \u274c Engine out operations are not yet considered \u274c AP performance when flying turbulence might not be satisfying in all cases \u274c AP is not disconnected due to turbulence \u274c Time compression is not supported Engines \u274c Realistic start-up procedure is missing \u274c During start, no fuel flow is shown \u274c Realistic Descent/ Approach idle parameters / drag. \u274c Time compression is not supported (fuel burn is not adapted for time compression) Autothrust \u274c N1 thrust limit displayed and achieved may differ slightly in certain situations First implementation available \ud83d\udd38 Some transitions might not be as they should or are missing \ud83d\udd38 Engines can now be started, realistic start-up procedure is in work \ud83d\udd38 principle go-around mode has been added but not all conditions are respected yet \ud83d\udd38 NAV mode is for the time being using default flight plan manager until the custom is ready \ud83d\udd38 altitude constraints seem to work with CLB and DES (there are many situations out there, so there can still be unknown bugs) \ud83d\udd38 FLEX thrust limit is still rough and is also not adapted for Mach yet \ud83d\udd38 Thrust limits are already very good but might be improved in the future (they are currently lacking adaptation for Mach) \ud83d\udd38 Thrust limits are now corrected for air-conditioning and anti-ice yet \ud83d\udd38 Flare Law has been improved to handle fast raising ground before the runway; when in 200 ft RA, the ground should in the area of the runway slope, otherwise issues are to be expected Considered solved \u2714\ufe0f In case the default AP is for any reason engaged it will be automatically disconnected \u2714\ufe0f In manual approach LOC and G/S might be lost too fast with mode reversion to HDG + V/S \u2714\ufe0f FMA indications for ATHR system are missing \u2714\ufe0f due to this workaround, the engine EGT can go into read area when in (OP) CLB/DES (see workaround above) \u2714\ufe0f due to missing custom ATHR system, the (OP) CLB/DES modes might need manual thrust control -> a simple and hacky workaround has been added though \u2714\ufe0f FD off/on does not deactivate all FMA items \u2714\ufe0f Engagement of AP with FD off is incorrect \u2714\ufe0f Flight Director (FD) guidance in pitch is not fully satisfying yet \u2714\ufe0f Fuel used since start is not shown correctly on ECAM fuel page, it's basically 0 \u2714\ufe0f AP is disconnected due to sidestick or rudder input \u2714\ufe0f EWD has been improved to correctly display N2 > 100 \u2714\ufe0f Fuel flow is currently always in KG \u2714\ufe0f Pause and slew detection should be ok now \u2714\ufe0f SPD/MACH hold might when flying in curves has been improved \u2714\ufe0f Fuel burn should be correct in flight \u2714\ufe0f ATHR implementation is already quite complete \u2714\ufe0f Switched to different default input source for LNAV, transitions are now much better \u2714\ufe0f LOC* has has been improved in capturing performance Mapping of events to control autopilot / autothrust \u26a0\ufe0f Not all events are working and it's also difficult to map all default events because there is no 100% match. The recommendation is to use a combination of default events and the custom events to trigger the FCU. This has been tested with the Honeycomb Bravo Throttle using SPAD.next or FSUIPC. \u2139\ufe0f You find an event file for FSUIPC in subfolder FSUIPC. This needs to be placed in the FSUIPC folder beside the ini-file to be recognized. Then you can select those custom events for button press (for FS Control). \u2139\ufe0f You find an profile for SPAD.neXt in subfolder SPAD.neXt.

The values of the throttle axis range from -1.0 to 1.0 independently if you're using reverse on axis or not. When the current throttle position is larger or equal then the start position and smaller or equal than the end position of a detent, the throttles are considered to be in that detent. Ensure that: detents are large enough defined so hardware inaccuracy is taken into account (i.e. detents on the Thrustmaster TCA are not that hard and values can quite differ even one thinks it's in the detent there is enough range between the detents (meaning end position of detent and start position of next detent are at least wide as the detents) Important : if you have issues, don't look at the animation part to check if it's in the detent. Check the values in the EFB, those are relevant and not the animation. Autothrust does not hold target speed in manual flight Important rule is to always monitor the FMA. If you're in manual flight and you're in CLB , OP CLB , DES or OP DES the autothrust applies either THR CLB (limited by the throttle levers) or THR IDLE . The speed needs to be controlled by pitch and in manual flight the pilot is responsible to do so by following the flight director orders. If this is not your desired mode, you can do two things: engage another vertical mode (i.e. V/S or FPA) disengage both flight directors, this will force the Autothrust into SPEED mode Reminder : Speed is only controlled properly using thrust when Autothrust is engaged and active, thrust levers are in detent CLB, active FMA mode is SPEED or MACH . SRS does not engage on take-off SRS mode needs at least a V2 entered on TO PERF page. Additionally it does only engage when the detents are set properly. If no FLX temperature is set, this needs to be TOGA. If a FLX temperature is set, it's FLX/MCT or TOGA. Other conditions: plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground Flaps extended at least in position 1+F RWY does not engage on take-off There is currently no auto-tune available for the LOC on take-off. You need to enter the right frequency manually. Beside that RWY mode only engages with the following conditions: LOC signal valid LOC deviation smaller than 1/2 dot Deviation between plane heading and LOC bearing is < 20\u00b0 Plane needs to be at least 30 s on ground Flaps extended at least in position 1+F LVR CLB flashes immediately after lift-off Ensure that both thrust reduction and acceleration altitude on TO PERF page are properly setup. LAND mode does not engage Before reaching 400 ft radio altitude the FMA needs to show LOC and G/S . If one of them is still in capture mode ( LOC* or G/S* ) you need to perform a go around maneuver or land manually, LAND will not engage that way. Autoland does not perform as expected The Autoland system is quite complex and is dependent on multiple environmental conditions to work properly, such as: LOC accuracy in terms of alignment of heading to runway heading alignment on runway centerline availability down to 0 ft and also during roll-out G/S accuracy in terms of alignment to correct height (50 ft over runway threshold) availability down to 50 ft ground in front of runway threshold needs to be more or less stable (no fast raising terrain) beginning 200 ft radio altitude Reminder: If the autoland warning light goes on it's IRL procedure to go around! Unfortunately a lot of runways (either using Navigraph or not) have issues for LOC and/or G/S, either in terms of alignment or availability. On many runways you loose the LOC during ROLL OUT . In that case the roll out has to be performed manually by disengaging the AP. Flight controls are not working after reload of the sim or airplane Ensure that no SimConnect.cfg is in the Documents folder of your user profile. An older version of Kinetic Assistant installed that file and it's causing issues with SimConnect connection between our custom systems and the sim. Autopilot is osciallating on approach or in flight Ensure that you get enough frames per second (see on top). Climb performance is not satisfying or plane drops or increases nose heavily on approach Ensure that you're using modern flight model (Options -> General -> Flight Model). Beside that also ensure that you don't have any mods or add-ons installed that have influence on the flight model or other physics. Autopilot oscillates when using time compression Time compression is not fully supported yet, this applies also to fuel burn (time compression is not taken into account). The reason why it can work for some and not for others is how time compression is working. For example when using time compression of 2x for the custom systems it's like having 1/2 of your displayed fps, when you're using 4x it's like 1/4 of it. So taking into account the 17 fps requirement it means you need ~ 30 fps and ~ 45 fps for 4x to work somehow, at least for smooth cruise. When you encounter heavy turbulence it might be needed that time compression is reduced. For the time being we do not recommend using it. Ailerons are not working when using the keyboard There is currently an issue with the associated events and there is currently no way to solve it. We highly recommend using a controller with an axis assigned to use the plane.","title":"Typical issues and how to solve them"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#known-issues","text":"","title":"Known issues"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#not-solved-or-missing-this-list-is-not-conclusive","text":"","title":"Not solved or missing (this list is not conclusive)"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#flight-management","text":"\u274c Due to lack of LNAV, the flaws of the default flight plan manager still apply (bank to left or right shortly after TO etc) \u274c Due to lack of VNAV, DES mode is currently only using SPD/MACH \u274c Due to lack of VNAV, RNAV approaches are not supported yet","title":"Flight Management"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#autopilot","text":"\u274c AP disconnect does not trigger master warning etc. \u274c NAV mode being armed might show dashes in the FCU instead of selected HDG \u274c Engine out operations are not yet considered \u274c AP performance when flying turbulence might not be satisfying in all cases \u274c AP is not disconnected due to turbulence \u274c Time compression is not supported","title":"Autopilot"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#engines","text":"\u274c Realistic start-up procedure is missing \u274c During start, no fuel flow is shown \u274c Realistic Descent/ Approach idle parameters / drag. \u274c Time compression is not supported (fuel burn is not adapted for time compression)","title":"Engines"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#autothrust","text":"\u274c N1 thrust limit displayed and achieved may differ slightly in certain situations","title":"Autothrust"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#first-implementation-available","text":"\ud83d\udd38 Some transitions might not be as they should or are missing \ud83d\udd38 Engines can now be started, realistic start-up procedure is in work \ud83d\udd38 principle go-around mode has been added but not all conditions are respected yet \ud83d\udd38 NAV mode is for the time being using default flight plan manager until the custom is ready \ud83d\udd38 altitude constraints seem to work with CLB and DES (there are many situations out there, so there can still be unknown bugs) \ud83d\udd38 FLEX thrust limit is still rough and is also not adapted for Mach yet \ud83d\udd38 Thrust limits are already very good but might be improved in the future (they are currently lacking adaptation for Mach) \ud83d\udd38 Thrust limits are now corrected for air-conditioning and anti-ice yet \ud83d\udd38 Flare Law has been improved to handle fast raising ground before the runway; when in 200 ft RA, the ground should in the area of the runway slope, otherwise issues are to be expected","title":"First implementation available"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#considered-solved","text":"\u2714\ufe0f In case the default AP is for any reason engaged it will be automatically disconnected \u2714\ufe0f In manual approach LOC and G/S might be lost too fast with mode reversion to HDG + V/S \u2714\ufe0f FMA indications for ATHR system are missing \u2714\ufe0f due to this workaround, the engine EGT can go into read area when in (OP) CLB/DES (see workaround above) \u2714\ufe0f due to missing custom ATHR system, the (OP) CLB/DES modes might need manual thrust control -> a simple and hacky workaround has been added though \u2714\ufe0f FD off/on does not deactivate all FMA items \u2714\ufe0f Engagement of AP with FD off is incorrect \u2714\ufe0f Flight Director (FD) guidance in pitch is not fully satisfying yet \u2714\ufe0f Fuel used since start is not shown correctly on ECAM fuel page, it's basically 0 \u2714\ufe0f AP is disconnected due to sidestick or rudder input \u2714\ufe0f EWD has been improved to correctly display N2 > 100 \u2714\ufe0f Fuel flow is currently always in KG \u2714\ufe0f Pause and slew detection should be ok now \u2714\ufe0f SPD/MACH hold might when flying in curves has been improved \u2714\ufe0f Fuel burn should be correct in flight \u2714\ufe0f ATHR implementation is already quite complete \u2714\ufe0f Switched to different default input source for LNAV, transitions are now much better \u2714\ufe0f LOC* has has been improved in capturing performance","title":"Considered solved"},{"location":"start/autopilot-fbw/#mapping-of-events-to-control-autopilot-autothrust","text":"\u26a0\ufe0f Not all events are working and it's also difficult to map all default events because there is no 100% match.
